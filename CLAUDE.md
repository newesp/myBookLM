# myBookLM — Claude Code Development Guide

## Architecture

**Backend**: FastAPI + uvicorn. Single `app.py` entry point; all logic lives in `backend/` modules.  
**Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build tool. Static files served from `/static`.  
**Database**: SQLite (`data/app.db`). Schema defined in `backend/db.py`.  
**Config**: `data/config.json`. Read/write logic in `backend/config.py` (deep-merge on load).

## Running

```bash
python app.py   # http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

On startup, any job with `status='running'` is reset to `'paused'` (lifespan handler in `backend/app.py`).

## Source types

| Type | Storage | Detected by |
|------|---------|-------------|
| skill.md | `skills/{slug}/SKILL.md` + `skills/{slug}/chapters/*.md` | File exists |
| embedding | `data/app.db` chunks table + `skills/{slug}/META.json` | DB chunks exist |
| Both | Both of the above | skill.md full-text injection takes priority in RAG |

## Key modules

**`backend/llm.py`** — `chat()` unified interface; four private functions `_claude / _gemini / _grok / _ollama`. Always use `or` for config fallbacks (`cfg.get("key") or "default"`), not `.get("key", "default")` — an empty string won't trigger the `.get()` default but will break the URL.

**`backend/embedding.py`** — `chunk_text()` (CHUNK_SIZE=800, OVERLAP=100) → Ollama `/api/embeddings` → pure-Python cosine similarity. `has_embedding(slug)` queries the DB. `_running_tasks` dict tracks asyncio Tasks (same pattern as `conversion.py`).

**`backend/chat.py`** — `build_source_context` is `async` (must `await` embed_text). skill.md sources get full-text injection; embedding-only sources get top-k retrieval. Ollama config is always read for embedding even when a different chat provider is active.

**`backend/conversion.py`** — `slugify()` defined here (reuse it). `_running_tasks` dict. Chapter files are the checkpoint: if the file exists, the chapter is skipped on resume.

**`backend/sources.py`** — `delete_source()` removes the filesystem directory, DB chunks, `source_topics` rows, and `source_pdf` rows. `list_sources(skills_dir, topic_id=None)` merges filesystem scan with a `GROUP BY source_slug` query on the chunks table; if `topic_id` is given (truthy), only sources whose `slug` is in `source_topics` for that topic are returned. `list_pdfs(books_dir, skills_dir)` also returns each PDF's `derived_sources: [{slug, name, types, chunk_count, chapter_count}]` by joining `source_pdf` with the source list. `link_source_pdf(slug, pdf_filename)` (called from `embedding.py` route handler and from `conversion.py` after the slug is finalized) is the only writer to `source_pdf`. A source whose `source_pdf` row points at a slug that no longer exists is surfaced with `missing: true` so the user can clean it up.

**`backend/topics.py`** — Topic CRUD + many-to-many `source_topics` membership. `default_topic_id()` returns the lowest-id topic (seeded as "預設" by `init_db`). `add_source_to_topic(slug, topic_id)` is idempotent (`INSERT OR IGNORE`); jobs call it after the slug is finalized so newly-converted sources land in the topic the user was in. `delete_topic()` refuses to delete the default and reassigns its conversations to the default.

## Database schema highlights

```sql
jobs: id, pdf_path, book_title, skill_slug, skill_dir,
      status, job_type('skill'|'embedding'),
      current_step, total_chapters, completed_chapters, chapters_json,
      tokens_in, tokens_out, cost, error, provider, model,
      topic_id  -- which topic the produced source should be assigned to

conversations: id, title, created_at, updated_at, topic_id

chunks: id, source_slug, chunk_idx, text, embedding BLOB
        INDEX idx_chunks_slug ON chunks(source_slug)

topics: id, name, created_at
        -- A "default" row is seeded by init_db (lowest id, name="預設").

source_topics: source_slug, topic_id   -- many-to-many; PK both columns
        INDEX idx_source_topics_topic, idx_source_topics_slug

source_pdf: slug PK, pdf_filename, created_at
        INDEX idx_source_pdf_pdf
        -- 'this slug was produced from this PDF'. One PDF may map to many
        -- slugs (re-runs of skill / embed produce different slugs).
        -- init_db backfills this from existing `jobs` rows so old data
        -- still appears under its PDF in the new PDF panel.
```

`job_type`, `jobs.topic_id`, and `conversations.topic_id` were added after initial release — `init_db()` runs `ALTER TABLE` migrations for existing databases and backfills any null `conversations.topic_id` to the default topic.

## Frontend conventions

- `data-p="ollama" data-f="embed_model"` — settings input binding. `data-f` supports dot notation (`pricing.input_per_mtok`).
- `state.selected` is a `Set<string>` of slugs.
- `state.topicId` (number, 0 = "全部" / no filter) drives source + conversation filtering and is persisted in `localStorage` under `myBookLM.topicId`. Switching topics clears `state.selected` and `state.convId` so stale slugs/conversations don't leak across topics.
- PDF button disable pattern: `runConvert()` disables both buttons and shows a spinner; on success `loadJobs()` re-renders the list (buttons restore naturally); on error, buttons are re-enabled manually.
- Sidebar width is persisted in `localStorage` via the resizer drag handler.

## Topics API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/topics` | List topics with `source_count` |
| POST | `/api/topics` | `{name}` → create |
| PATCH | `/api/topics/{id}` | `{name}` → rename |
| DELETE | `/api/topics/{id}` | Delete (rejects default; reassigns conversations) |
| GET | `/api/sources/{slug}/topics` | Returns `{slug, topic_ids: [..]}` |
| PUT | `/api/sources/{slug}/topics` | `{topic_ids: [..]}` → replace this source's topic memberships |
| PUT | `/api/topics/{id}/sources` | `{slugs: [..]}` → replace this topic's source list (preserves each slug's other topic memberships) |
| GET | `/api/sources?topic_id=N` | `topic_id=0` (or omitted) returns all |
| GET | `/api/conversations?topic_id=N` | Same convention |
| POST | `/api/conversations` | Body `{topic_id}` (defaults to default topic) |
| POST | `/api/jobs`, `/api/pdfs/embed`, `/api/sources/from-response` | Accept optional `topic_id`; the resulting source is auto-assigned |

## Important notes

- `.gitignore` excludes `data/`, `books/*.pdf`, `skills/`, `.venv/`
- `books/` keeps a `.gitkeep`
- `DELETE /api/jobs/{id}` accepts `keep_files` (default `False`). Backend behavior: with `keep_files=False`, embedding jobs drop chunks (and remove the dir if it has no `SKILL.md`); skill jobs delete the whole `skills/{slug}` dir. With `keep_files=True`, only the `jobs` row is removed. **The frontend always passes `keep_files=true`** — the right-panel "刪除" is log-only by design; users delete actual sources from the per-PDF derived list in the left panel (which calls `DELETE /api/sources/{slug}`).
- skill.md conversion requires a 7B+ LLM — 3B models reliably fail JSON planning
